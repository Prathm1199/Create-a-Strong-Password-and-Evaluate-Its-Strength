5. Consider a password manager to store complex passwords securely.

## Common Password Attacks

 - Brute Force: Tries all possible combinations until success.
 - Dictionary Attack: Uses common words or leaked password lists.
 - Phishing Attack: Tricks users into entering credentials on fake login pages.
